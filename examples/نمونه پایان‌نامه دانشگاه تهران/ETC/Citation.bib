abstract = {Any assessment of classification techniques requires data. This document describes sets of data intended to aid in the assessment of classification work. A number of data sets are described; each data set consists a number of objects, and each object is described by a group of features (also referred to as discriminators). Leveraged by a quantity of hand-classified data, each object within each data set represents a single flow of TCP packets between client and server. The features for each object consist of the (application-centric) classification derived elsewhere and a number of features derived as input to probabilistic classification techniques. In addition to describing the features, we also provide information allowing interested parties to retrieve these data sets for use in their own work. The data sets contain no site-identifying information; each object is only described by a set of statistics and a class that defines the causal application.},

@article{Crotti2007a,
abstract = {The classification of IP flows according to the application that generated them is at the basis of any modern network management platform. However, classical techniques such as the ones based on the analysis of transport layer or appli- cation layer information are rapidly becoming ineffective. In this paper we present a flow classification mechanism based on three simple properties of the captured IP packets: their size, inter-arrival time and arrival order. Even though these quantities have already been used in the past to define classification techniques, our contribution is based on new structures called protocol fingerprints, which express such quantities in a compact and efficient way, and on a simple classification algorithm based on normalized thresholds. Al- though at a very early stage of development, the proposed technique is showing promising preliminary results from the classification of a reduced set of protocols. In this paper we have proposed a statistical classification technique based on the analysis of simple properties of net- work traffic. We introduced what we call protocol finger-prints, i.e., quantities that are at the basis of the training phase, and that express, in a compact and efficient way, the main statistical properties used to characterize each proto- col: inter-arrival times, size of the IP packets, and the order in which they are seen by the classifier. Preliminary experi- mental analysis has shown promising results: the technique can determine with a relatively small error ratio the appli- cation protocol behind network flows, at least with a re- duced set of protocols, when the classifier has been properly trained. The analysis has also shown that the Gaussian filtering operation used to derive protocol fingerprints seems instru- mental in the ability of the classifier to deal with noise such as jitter and unexpected changes in packet size. Further- more, the normalized thresholds used by the classification algorithm can be an effective tool in discriminating when traffic does not belong to any of the fingerprinted categories: this improves the effectiveness of the technique in dealing with non-fingerprinted traffic, which in turn is fundamental given the well known problems related to the accuracy, or lack of thereof, of generally-applicable training mechanisms. Our algorithm and definition of fingerprint are still at an early stage of development: the magnitude of work needed to prove its general applicability and the issues that still need to be analyzed have been discussed in Sections 6 and 7. However, we believe that the preliminary results presented in this paper are promising enough to warrant further work on this technique.},

abstract = {In this paper we will develop certain extensions and refinements of coding theory for noisy communication channels. First, a refinement of the argument based on "random" coding will be used to obtain an upper bound on the probability of error for an optimal code in the memoryless finite discrete channel. Next, an equation is obtained for the capacity of a finite state channel when the state can be calculated at both transmitting and receiving terminals. An analysis is also made of the more complex case where the state is calculable at the transmitting point but not necessarily at the receiving point.},

@article{Kamata,
abstract = {Although the content of sensor messages describing “events of interest” may be encrypted to provide confidentiality, the context surrounding these events may also be sensitive and therefore should be protected from eavesdroppers. An adversary armed with knowledge of the network deployment, routing algorithms, and the base-station (data sink) location can infer the temporal patterns of interesting events by merely monitoring the arrival of packets at the sink, thereby allowing the adversary to remotely track the spatio-temporal evolution of a sensed event. In this paper we introduce the problem of temporal privacy for delay-tolerant sensor networks, and propose adaptive buffering at intermediate nodes on the source-sink routing path to obfuscate temporal information from the adversary. We first present the effect of buffering on temporal privacy using an information-theoretic formulation, and then examine the effect that delaying packets has on buffer occupancy. We observe that temporal privacy and efficient buffer utilization are contrary objectives, and then present an adaptive buffering strategy that effectively manages these tradeoffs. Finally, we evaluate our privacy enhancement strategies using simulations, where privacy is quantified in terms of the adversary's mean square error.},

@article{Li2009b,
abstract = {Much of the existing work on wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has focused on addressing the power and computational resource constraints of WSNs by the design of specific routing, MAC, and cross-layer protocols. Recently, there have been heightened privacy concerns over the data collected by and transmitted through WSNs. The wireless transmission required by a WSN, and the self-organizing nature of its architecture, makes privacy protection for WSNs an especially challenging problem. This paper provides a state-of-the-art survey of privacy-preserving techniques for WSNs. In particular, we review two main categories of privacy-preserving techniques for protecting two types of private information, data-oriented and context-oriented privacy, respectively. We also discuss a number of important open challenges for future research. Our hope is that this paper sheds some light on a fruitful direction of future research for privacy preservation in WSNs.},
